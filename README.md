# dummycloud-rust
A rust implemetation of dummycloud.
A mini project for myself to properly learn the in's and out's of Rust and my data sucking robot.

## Goals
- To have near feature parity of dummycloud functions in a cross platform binary
- I want to be able to run this binary on an old Android phone, my Windows PC, Raspberry Pi, or on the vaccuum itself.
    _Why?_ Why not ;)? I have more flexibility to fiddle with my network and routing if I can make it run on a wider array of platforms.
- Easy for beginners to checkout, modify, build, deploy

## Credits
None of this would be possible without prior efforts by [@dgiese](https://github.com/dgiese/) from [dustcloud](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud) and [@Hypfer](https://github.com/Hypfer/) from [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo)
